But there is no supply-side mitigation roadmap yet. We need criteria to decide where to focus efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we identify the 425 biggest fossil fuel extraction projects globally (defined as &amp;gt;1 gigaton potential CO2 emissions). We list these “carbon bombs” by name, show in which countries they are located and calculate their potential emissions which combined exceed the global 1.5 °C carbon budget by a factor of two. Already producing carbon bombs account for a significant percentage of global fossil fuel extraction. But 40% of carbon bombs have not yet started extraction.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Don't even think about it</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/donteventhinkaboutit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/donteventhinkaboutit/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A psychological approach to the question : why don&amp;rsquo;t we care about climate change ?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Earthmasters</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/earthmasters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/earthmasters/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Deconstruction of the myth of geo-engineering solutions and explains how some people want to play god with the climate.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Govern the Climate</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/gouvernerleclimat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/gouvernerleclimat/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a great book that goes through the history of all the international conferences about climate change and shows how and why things have not evolved.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>IPCC reports</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/ipcc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/ipcc/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The most important and reliable scientific source about climate change.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Keeling Report</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/keelingreport/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/keelingreport/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This report is a statement of the consensus of the conference made on March 12, 1963
by the Conservation Foundation. This was a conference of scholars to discuss the problem
of rising carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. The conferees were ecologists,
chemists, physicists and others. The report was prepared by Noel Eichhorn of The

But the pledges by governments to date – even if fully achieved – fall well short of what is required to bring global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2050 and give the world an even chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 °C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This special report is the world’s first comprehensive study of how to transition to a net zero energy system by 2050 while ensuring stable and affordable energy supplies, providing universal energy access, and enabling robust economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>One last chance.</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/articles/onelastchance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/articles/onelastchance/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One last chance: The defining year for the planet by Justin Worland.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Planetary Boundaries</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/papers/planetaryboundaries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/papers/planetaryboundaries/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Earth beyond six of nine planetary boundaries&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Scenario for the derivation of global CO2 reduction targets and implementation strategies</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/wbgu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/wbgu/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of the scenario are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropogenic emissions must be reduced to almost zero over the
very long term, i.e. within a period of several centuries. The climate
system permits a considerable amount of freedom with respect to how
the emission profile is actually shaped, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current emission patterns could be continued for another 25 years
(“Business As Usual”), but this would then demand such drastic
reduction measures within only a few years that the structures and
technologies capable of producing such levels of abatement are not
even remotely conceivable at present.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Brundtland report</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/ourcommonfuture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/ourcommonfuture/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This report is &amp;ldquo;A global agenda for change&amp;rdquo; - this was what the World Commission on Environment and

change and on the economic costs, and has used a number of different techniques to
assess costs and risks. From all of these perspectives, the evidence gathered by the
Review leads to a simple conclusion: the benefits of strong and early action far
outweigh the economic costs of not acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change will affect the basic elements of life for people around the world –
access to water, food production, health, and the environment. Hundreds of millions
of people could suffer hunger, water shortages and coastal flooding as the world
warms.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Unhabitable Earth</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/unhabitableearth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/unhabitableearth/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The book explores various possibilities for Earth&amp;rsquo;s future across a spectrum of predicted future temperature ranges.
