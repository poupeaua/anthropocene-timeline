at least one ecological threat between now and 2050.
The 19 countries with the highest number of threats
have a population of 2.1 billion people. These countries
face four to six ecological threats and more than half
are among the 40 least peaceful nations. The three
countries with the highest exposure to ecological
shocks are Afghanistan, which is facing six ecological
threats and Mozambique and Namibia, which are each
facing five. Another 16 countries are facing four
ecological threats.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Global Climate Report</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/noaaglobalclimatereport/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/noaaglobalclimatereport/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The year 2023 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850 at 1.18°C (2.12°F) above the 20th century average of 13.9°C (57.0°F). This value is 0.15°C (0.27°F) more than the previous record set in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10 warmest years in the 174-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2014–2023).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note, the year 2005, which was the first year to set a new global temperature record in the 21st century, is now the 12th-warmest year on record.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>IEA World Energy Outlook reports</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/iea/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/iea/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The IEA’s flagship World Energy Outlook (WEO) is the most authoritative source of global energy analysis and projections. Updated annually to reflect the latest energy data, technology and market trends, and government policies, it explores a range of possible energy futures and their implications for energy security, access and emissions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>IPCC reports</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/ipcc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/ipcc/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The most important and reliable scientific source about climate change.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Keeling Report</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/keelingreport/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/keelingreport/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This report is a statement of the consensus of the conference made on March 12, 1963
by the Conservation Foundation. This was a conference of scholars to discuss the problem
of rising carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. The conferees were ecologists,
chemists, physicists and others. The report was prepared by Noel Eichhorn of The
Foundation&amp;rsquo;s research staff.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Living Planet Report</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/livingplanetreport/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/livingplanetreport/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Living Planet Report 2020 clearly
outlines how humanity’s increasing destruction of nature is having
catastrophic impacts not only on wildlife populations but also on
human health and all aspects of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highlights that a deep cultural and systemic shift is urgently
needed, one that so far our civilisation has failed to embrace: a
transition to a society and economic system that values nature,
stops taking it for granted and recognises that we depend on nature
more than nature depends on us.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Net Zero by 2050</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/netzeroby2050/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/netzeroby2050/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The number of countries announcing pledges to achieve net zero emissions over the coming decades continues to grow. But the pledges by governments to date – even if fully achieved – fall well short of what is required to bring global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2050 and give the world an even chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 °C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This special report is the world’s first comprehensive study of how to transition to a net zero energy system by 2050 while ensuring stable and affordable energy supplies, providing universal energy access, and enabling robust economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Scenario for the derivation of global CO2 reduction targets and implementation strategies</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/wbgu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/wbgu/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of the scenario are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropogenic emissions must be reduced to almost zero over the
very long term, i.e. within a period of several centuries. The climate
system permits a considerable amount of freedom with respect to how
the emission profile is actually shaped, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current emission patterns could be continued for another 25 years
(“Business As Usual”), but this would then demand such drastic
reduction measures within only a few years that the structures and
technologies capable of producing such levels of abatement are not
even remotely conceivable at present.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Brundtland report</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/ourcommonfuture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/ourcommonfuture/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This report is &amp;ldquo;A global agenda for change&amp;rdquo; - this was what the World Commission on Environment and
Development was asked to formulate. It was an urgent call by the General Assembly of the
United Nations: to propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development
by the year 2000 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The New Plastics Economy</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/thenewplasticseconomy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/thenewplasticseconomy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The report explores plastics and plastic
packaging issues in particular: how can collaboration along the extended global plastic
packaging production and after-use value chain, as well as with governments
and NGOs, achieve systemic change to overcome stalemates in today’s plastics
economy in order to move to a more circular model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Plastics Economy aims to set an initial direction and contribute to the
evidence base by synthesizing information from across many dispersed sources.
It assesses the benefits and drawbacks of plastic packaging today, and makes
the case for rethinking the current plastics economy. It lays out the ambitions and
benefits of the New Plastics Economy – a system aiming to achieve drastically
better economic and environmental outcomes. It proposes a new approach and
action plan to get there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Stern Review</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/thesternreview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/thesternreview/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This Review has assessed a wide range of evidence on the impacts of climate
change and on the economic costs, and has used a number of different techniques to
assess costs and risks. From all of these perspectives, the evidence gathered by the
Review leads to a simple conclusion: the benefits of strong and early action far
outweigh the economic costs of not acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change will affect the basic elements of life for people around the world –
access to water, food production, health, and the environment. Hundreds of millions
of people could suffer hunger, water shortages and coastal flooding as the world
warms.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Turn Down the Heat</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/turndowntheheat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/reports/turndowntheheat/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A new report synthesizing the latest scientific knowledge on global warming warns we’re
on a path to a 4 degree Celsius warmer world by the end of the century—with huge implications for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
