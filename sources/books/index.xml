The book is quite naive and its approach is sometimes confusing but it at least informs people about climate change, biodiversity destruction, energy and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Merchants of Doubt</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/merchantsofdoubt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/merchantsofdoubt/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Only One Earth</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/onlyoneearth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/onlyoneearth/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This book was originally produced in 1972 as a report commissioned by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. It was prepared with help from 152 committee members from 58 countries. As well as being something of a classic, it is fascinating to read it 50 years later, containing as it does a range of accurate predictions, warnings and suggestions – much of which have been ignored for half a century. The broad outcome is that, had the world paid attention to its contents and taken suitable action, we would not be in the mess we are in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sleep quietly until 2100</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/dormeztranquillesjusquen2100/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/dormeztranquillesjusquen2100/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A book har to read in my opinion as it goes in all directions, left and right, with a confusing structure. I would better recommend Jean-Marc Jancovici&amp;rsquo;s conferences (available on Youtube for example): he is clearer orally.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Coal Question</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/thecoalquestion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/thecoalquestion/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The central thesis was that the supremacy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland over global affairs was transitory, given the finite nature of its primary energy resource. In propounding this thesis, Jevons covered a range of issues central to sustainability, including limits to growth, overpopulation, overshoot, energy return on energy input (EROEI), taxation of energy resources, renewable energy alternatives, and resource peaking.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Discovery of Global Warming</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/discoveryglobalwarming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/discoveryglobalwarming/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;History about how Global Warming was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Limits to Growth</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/thelimitstogrowth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/thelimitstogrowth/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A classic and a must-read.

Wallace-Wells&amp;rsquo; argues that even with active intervention, the effects of climate change will have catastrophic impacts across multiple spheres.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Thinking about degrowth</title><link>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/penserladecroissance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anthropocenetimeline.com/sources/books/penserladecroissance/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A book written by different specialists where each has its own chapter.
