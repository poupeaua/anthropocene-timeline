This book was originally produced in 1972 as a report commissioned by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. It was prepared with help from 152 committee members from 58 countries. As well as being something of a classic, it is fascinating to read it 50 years later, containing as it does a range of accurate predictions, warnings and suggestions – much of which have been ignored for half a century. The broad outcome is that, had the world paid attention to its contents and taken suitable action, we would not be in the mess we are in.
