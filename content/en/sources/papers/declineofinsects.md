The authors used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomassusing Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flyinginsect biomass over the 27 years of study. 

We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a foodsource, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.
