The conclusions of the scenario are as follows:

Anthropogenic emissions must be reduced to almost zero over the
very long term, i.e. within a period of several centuries. The climate
system permits a considerable amount of freedom with respect to how
the emission profile is actually shaped, however.

The current emission patterns could be continued for another 25 years
(“Business As Usual”), but this would then demand such drastic
reduction measures within only a few years that the structures and
technologies capable of producing such levels of abatement are not
even remotely conceivable at present.

The Council therefore believes that an appropriate and feasible
emission profile must involve a reduction of global CO2 emissions at a
rate of roughly 1% per year over more than 150 years, following a
short transitional period (of about 5 years).

In the medium term, this would require substantial abatement efforts
WBGU Statement to the First Session of the Conference of Parties 1
on the part of the industrialised nations. The Council proposes that the
measures engendered through Germany’s self-imposed commitment to
reduce CO2 emissions be implemented in a systematic manner. Internationally the countries have to come to agreements which extend
beyond the year 2000.
