The year 2023 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850 at 1.18°C (2.12°F) above the 20th century average of 13.9°C (57.0°F). This value is 0.15°C (0.27°F) more than the previous record set in 2016. 

The 10 warmest years in the 174-year record have all occurred during the last decade (2014–2023). 

Of note, the year 2005, which was the first year to set a new global temperature record in the 21st century, is now the 12th-warmest year on record. 

The year 2010, which had surpassed 2005 at the time, now ranks as the 11th-warmest year on record.
