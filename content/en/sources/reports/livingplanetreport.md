The Living Planet Report 2020 clearly
outlines how humanity’s increasing destruction of nature is having
catastrophic impacts not only on wildlife populations but also on
human health and all aspects of our lives.

This highlights that a deep cultural and systemic shift is urgently
needed, one that so far our civilisation has failed to embrace: a
transition to a society and economic system that values nature,
stops taking it for granted and recognises that we depend on nature
more than nature depends on us.

This is about rebalancing our relationship with the planet to
preserve the Earth’s amazing diversity of life and enable a just,
healthy and prosperous society – and ultimately to ensure our
own survival.

Nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in millions
of years.
