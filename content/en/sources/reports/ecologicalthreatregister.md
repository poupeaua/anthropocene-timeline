The ETR 2020 results show that 141 countries are exposed to
at least one ecological threat between now and 2050.
The 19 countries with the highest number of threats
have a population of 2.1 billion people. These countries
face four to six ecological threats and more than half
are among the 40 least peaceful nations. The three
countries with the highest exposure to ecological
shocks are Afghanistan, which is facing six ecological
threats and Mozambique and Namibia, which are each
facing five. Another 16 countries are facing four
ecological threats.

Approximately one billion people live in countries that
do not have the resilience to deal with the ecological
changes they are expected to face between now and
2050. Not all of these people will be displaced, however
it is likely that a large number of them will be. Pakistan,
with 220 million people is the country with the largest
number of people at risk, followed by Iran with 84
million people at risk. In such circumstances, even
small events could spiral into instability and violence
leading to mass population displacement, which in turn
would have negative implications for regional and
global security.

Ecological threats in many cases lead to humanitarian
emergencies. Currently, more than two billion people
globally face uncertain access to sufficient food for a
healthy life. This number is likely to increase to 3.5
billion by 2050.
