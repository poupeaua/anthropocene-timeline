The report explores plastics and plastic
packaging issues in particular: how can collaboration along the extended global plastic
packaging production and after-use value chain, as well as with governments
and NGOs, achieve systemic change to overcome stalemates in today’s plastics
economy in order to move to a more circular model?

The New Plastics Economy aims to set an initial direction and contribute to the
evidence base by synthesizing information from across many dispersed sources.
It assesses the benefits and drawbacks of plastic packaging today, and makes
the case for rethinking the current plastics economy. It lays out the ambitions and
benefits of the New Plastics Economy – a system aiming to achieve drastically
better economic and environmental outcomes. It proposes a new approach and
action plan to get there.
