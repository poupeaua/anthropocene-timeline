why:
    title: "Why an Anthropocene Timeline?"
    main: "We tend to forget. We forget what happened in the past, one year ago, one month ago and even one day ago sometimes.
            Ecology is a topic too important to be forgotten. 
            Media nowadays do not always help us to have a clear vision about this.
            A timeline is a way to remember what happened in the past."
    sub: "Remember, forever."

history:
    title: "History"
    main1: "Everything started in 2019, when I studied in the University of Chile. 
        I have always been interested in ecology but never really thought about getting deeper.
        I read the book 'This Changes Everything' by Naomi Klein and it literally changed everything in my life."
    main2: I had the idea of the timeline in 2022 when creating my personal website.
        The timeline stayed there for years without ever being shared.
    main3: In 2025, I decided to create a dedicated website for the timeline and share it with the world.
