##### Lots of joy and promises

Paris Agreement aims to reach zero net CO2 emissions by 2050: is it even possible ? Well let us be realistic for 5 seconds, if we consider a net zero emission by 2100 then {{< mylink name="(see graph from Our World in Data)" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-mitigation-2c?time=1905..2100" >}}:

*   In the Copenhagen Conference back in 2009, an analysis was made that indicates that in order not to reach 2°C we needed to have a **3%** reduction of global emission of greenhouse gazes per year.
    
*   In 2013, a new analysis showed that to reach the same objective we needed to have a **5%** reduction of global emission of grenhouse gazes per year.    

Unfortunately global emission have never decreased since 1850 (except during COVID19 crisis) and is still increasing exponentially.
